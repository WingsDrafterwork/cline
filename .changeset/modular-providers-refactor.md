Refactored API provider options UI to a modular component-based architecture. Each provider now has its own dedicated component file, improving maintainability, readability, and making future provider additions more straightforward. This refactoring:

- Extracts common UI patterns into reusable components
- Moves each provider to its own file for better separation of concerns
- Adds TypeScript typing for better code safety
- Reduces the main ApiOptions component size by 90%
- Adds detailed documentation for each provider component
- Improves test coverage and testability
